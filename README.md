# SDE Frontend (Group 1)

## Developing

Once you've cloned and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:
> (NOTE: If like Tom, your installation of dependencies failed for a "Platform not supported error", try 'npm i -f' to force install.)

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
